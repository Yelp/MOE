    r"""Implementation of a GaussianProcess via C++ wrappers: mean, variance, gradients thereof, and data I/O.

    .. Note:: Comments in this class are copied from this object's superclass in interfaces.gaussian_process_interface.py.

    Object that encapsulates Gaussian Process Priors (GPPs).  A GPP is defined by a set of
    (sample point, function value, noise variance) triples along with a covariance function that relates the points.
    Each point has dimension dim.  These are the training data; for example, each sample point might specify an experimental
    cohort and the corresponding function value is the objective measured for that experiment.  There is one noise variance
    value per function value; this is the measurement error and is treated as N(0, noise_variance) Gaussian noise.

    GPPs estimate a real process \ms f(x) = GP(m(x), k(x,x'))\me (see file docs).  This class deals with building an estimator
    to the actual process using measurements taken from the actual process--the (sample point, function val, noise) triple.
    Then predictions about unknown points can be made by sampling from the GPP--in particular, finding the (predicted)
    mean and variance.  These functions (and their gradients) are provided in ComputeMeanOfPoints, ComputeVarianceOfPoints,
    etc.

    Further mathematical details are given in the implementation comments, but we are essentially computing:

    | ComputeMeanOfPoints    : ``K(Xs, X) * [K(X,X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} * y = Ks^T * K^{-1} * y``
    | ComputeVarianceOfPoints: ``K(Xs, Xs) - K(Xs,X) * [K(X,X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} * K(X,Xs) = Kss - Ks^T * K^{-1} * Ks``

    This (estimated) mean and variance characterize the predicted distributions of the actual \ms m(x), k(x,x')\me
    functions that underly our GP.
