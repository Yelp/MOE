"""Implementations of the ABCs in the :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces` package using calls to the C++ library (GPP.so).

The modules in this package provide hooks into the C++ implementation of optimal_learning's features. There are functions
and classes for model selection, gaussian process construction, expected improvement optimization, etc.

See the package comments for :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces` for an overview of optimal_learning's capabilities.
