    Returns the optimal set of q points to sample CONCURRENTLY by solving the q,p-EI problem.  That is, we may want to run 4
    experiments at the same time and maximize the EI across all 4 experiments at once while knowing of 2 ongoing experiments
    (4,2-EI). This function handles this use case. Evaluation of q,p-EI (and its gradient) for q > 1 or p > 1 is expensive

    makes no external assumptions about the underlying objective function. Instead, it utilizes a feature of the

    Consider this as an alternative when multistart_expected_improvement_optimization() is too expensive. Since this function
    kernalizes 1,0-EI, it always hits the analytic case; hence it is much faster than q,0-EI which requires monte-carlo.
    Users will probably call one of this function's wrappers (e.g., constant_liar_expected_improvement_optimization() or
    kriging_believer_expected_improvement_optimization()) instead of accessing this directly.

    Calls into heuristic_expected_improvement_optimization_wrapper in cpp/GPP_python_expected_improvement.cpp.

    .. NOTE:: The following comments are copied from gpp_heuristic_expected_improvement_optimization.hpp, ComputeHeuristicSetOfPointsToSample().

    It heuristically solves the q,0-EI optimization problem. As a reminder, that problem is finding the set of q points
    that maximizes the Expected Improvement (saved in the output, best_points_to_sample). Solving for q points simultaneously
    usually requires monte-carlo iteration and is expensive. The heuristic here solves q-EI as a sequence of 1-EI problems.
    We solve 1-EI, and then we *ASSUME* an objective function value at the resulting optima. This process is repeated q times.
    It is perhaps more clear in pseudocode:
    points_to_sample = {}  // This stays empty! We are only working with 1,0-EI solves
    for i = 0:num_samples_to_generate-1 {
      // First, solve the 1,0-EI problem*
      new_point = ComputeOptimalPointToSampleWithRandomStarts(gaussian_process, points_to_sample, other_parameters)
      // *Estimate* the objective function value at new_point
      new_function_value = ESTIMATED_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION_VALUE(new_point, other_args)
      new_function_value_noise = ESTIMATED_NOISE_VARIANCE(new_point, other_args)
      // Write the estimated objective values to the GP as *truth*
      gaussian_process.AddPoint(new_point, new_function_value, new_function_value_noise)
      optimal_points_to_sample.append(new_point)
    }
    *Recall: each call to ComputeOptimalPointToSampleWithRandomStarts() (gpp_math.hpp) kicks off a round of MGD optimization of 1-EI.

    Note that ideally the estimated objective function value (and noise) would be measured from the real-world (e.g.,
    by running an experiment). Then this algorithm would be optimal. However, the estimate probably is not accurately
    representating of the true objective.

    The estimation is handled through the "estimation_policy" input. Passing a ConstantLiarEstimationPolicy or
    KrigingBelieverEstimationPolicy object to this function will produce the "Constant Liar" and "Kriging Believer"
    heuristics described in Ginsbourger 2008. The interface for estimation_policy is generic so users may specify
    other estimators as well.

    Contrast this appraoch with ComputeOptimalSetOfPointsToSample() (gpp_math.hpp) which solves all outputs of the q,0-EI
    problem simultaneously instead of one point (i.e., points_to_sample) at a time. This method is more accurate (b/c it
    does not attempt to estimate the behavior of the underlying objective function) but much more expensive (because it
    requires monte-carlo iteration).

    If num_samples_to_generate = 1, this is exactly the same as ComputeOptimalPointToSampleWithRandomStarts(); i.e.,
    both methods solve the 1-EI optimization problem the same way.

    Currently, during optimization, we recommend that the coordinates of the initial guesses not differ from the
    coordinates of the optima by more than about 1 order of magnitude. This is a very (VERY!) rough guideline for
    sizing the domain and num_multistarts; i.e., be wary of sets of initial guesses that cover the space too sparsely.

    Solution is guaranteed to lie within the region specified by "domain"; note that this may not be a
    local optima (i.e., the gradient may be substantially nonzero).

    .. WARNING:: this function fails if any step fails to find improvement! In that case, the return should not be
           read and status will report false.

    The "Kriging Believer" objective function estimation policy uses the Gaussian Process (i.e., the prior)

    estimate = GP.mean(point)
    This follows the usage in Ginsbourger 2008. Users may also want the estimate to depend on the GP variance
    at the evaluation point, so that the estimate reflects how confident the GP is in the prediction. Users may
    also specify std_devation_ceof:
    estimate = GP.mean(point) + std_deviation_coef * GP.variance(point)
    Note that the coefficient is signed, and analogously to ConstantLiar, larger positive values are more
    explorative and larger negative values are more exploitive.

        .. Note:: These comments were copied from this object's superclass in expected_improvement_interface.py.

        ``current_points`` is the q and points_to_sample is the p in q,p-EI.

        We compute ``EI(Xs) = E_n[[f^*_n(X) - min(f(Xs_1),...,f(Xs_m))]^+]``, where ``Xs`` are potential points
        to sample and ``X`` are already sampled points.  The ``^+`` indicates that the expression in the expectation evaluates to 0
        if it is negative.  ``f^*(X)`` is the MINIMUM over all known function evaluations (``points_sampled_value``), whereas
        ``f(Xs)`` are *GP-predicted* function evaluations.

        The EI is the expected improvement in the current best known objective function value that would result from sampling
        at ``points_to_sample``.

        In general, the EI expression is complex and difficult to evaluate; hence we use Monte-Carlo simulation to approximate it.
