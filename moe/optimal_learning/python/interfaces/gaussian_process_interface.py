"""Interface for a GaussianProcess: mean, variance, gradients thereof, and data I/O.

This file contains one class, GaussianProcessInterface. It specifies the interface that a GaussianProcess
implementation must satisfy in order to be used in computation/optimization of ExpectedImprovement, etc.
Python currently does not natively support interfaces, so we are commandeering ABCs for that purpose.

See package docs in interfaces/__init__.py for an introduction to Gaussian Processes.

    r"""Interface for a GaussianProcess: mean, variance, gradients thereof, and data I/O.

       and duplicated in cpp_wrappers/gaussian_process.py and python_version/gaussian_process.py.

    Object that encapsulates Gaussian Process Priors (GPPs).  A GPP is defined by a set of
    (sample point, function value, noise variance) triples along with a covariance function that relates the points.
    Each point has dimension dim.  These are the training data; for example, each sample point might specify an experimental
    cohort and the corresponding function value is the objective measured for that experiment.  There is one noise variance
    value per function value; this is the measurement error and is treated as N(0, noise_variance) Gaussian noise.

    GPPs estimate a real process \ms f(x) = GP(m(x), k(x,x'))\me (see file docs).  This class deals with building an estimator
    to the actual process using measurements taken from the actual process--the (sample point, function val, noise) triple.
    Then predictions about unknown points can be made by sampling from the GPP--in particular, finding the (predicted)
    mean and variance.  These functions (and their gradients) are provided in ComputeMeanOfPoints, ComputeVarianceOfPoints,
    etc.

    Further mathematical details are given in the implementation comments, but we are essentially computing:

    | ComputeMeanOfPoints    : ``K(Xs, X) * [K(X,X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} * y = Ks^T * K^{-1} * y``
    | ComputeVarianceOfPoints: ``K(Xs, Xs) - K(Xs,X) * [K(X,X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} * K(X,Xs) = Kss - Ks^T * K^{-1} * Ks``

    This (estimated) mean and variance characterize the predicted distributions of the actual \ms m(x), k(x,x')\me
    functions that underly our GP.
