"""Interfaces for optimization (maximization): OptimizableInterface for things that can be optimized and OptimizerInterface to perform the optimization.

First, implementation of these interfaces should be MAXIMIZERS.  We also use the term "optima," and unless we specifically
state otherwise, "optima" and "optimization" refer to "maxima" and "maximization," respectively.  (Note that
minimizing g(x) is equivalent to maximizing f(x) = -1 * g(x).)

See the file comments for gpp_optimization.hpp for further dicussion of optimization as well as the particular techniques available
through the C++ interface.

class OptimizableInterface(object, metaclass=ABCMeta):

    r"""Interface that an object must fulfill to be optimized by an implementation of OptimizerInterface.

    Below, ``f(x)`` is the scalar objective function represented by this object. ``x`` is a vector-valued input
    with ``problem_size`` dimensions. With ``f(x)`` (and/or its derivatives), a OptimizableInterface implementation
    can be hooked up to a OptimizerInterface implementation to find the maximum value of ``f(x)`` and the input
    ``x`` at which this maximum occurs.

    This interface is straightforward--we need the ability to compute the problem size (how many independent parameters to
    optimize) as well as the ability to compute ``f(x)`` and/or its various derivatives. An implementation of ``f(x)`` is
    required; this allows for derivative-free optimization methods. Providing derivatives opens the door to more
    advanced/efficient techniques (e.g., gradient descent, BFGS, Newton).

    This interface is meant to be generic. For example, when optimizing the log marginal likelihood of a GP model
    (wrt hyperparameters of covariance; e.g., python_version.log_likelihood.GaussianProcessLogMarginalLikelihood)
    ``f`` is the log marginal, ``x`` is the vector of hyperparameters, and ``problem_size`` is ``num_hyperparameters``.
    Note that log marginal and covariance both have an associated spatial dimension, and this is NOT ``problem_size``.
    For Expected Improvement (e.g., python_version.expected_improvement.ExpectedImprovement), ``f`` would be the EI,
    ``x`` is the new experiment point (or points) being optimized, and ``problem_size`` is ``dim`` (or ``num_points*dim``).
