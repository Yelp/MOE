Covariance functions have a few fundamental properties (see references at the bottom for full details).  In short,
they are SPSD (symmetric positive semi-definite): ``k(x,x') = k(x', x)`` for any ``x,x'`` and ``k(x,x) >= 0`` for all ``x``.
As a consequence, covariance matrices are SPD as long as the input points are all distinct.

Additionally, the Square Exponential and Matern covariances (as well as other functions) are stationary. In essence,
this means they can be written as ``k(r) = k(|x - x'|) = k(x, x') = k(x', x)``.  So they operate on distances between
points as opposed to the points themselves.  The name stationary arises because the covariance is the same
modulo linear shifts: ``k(x+a, x'+a) = k(x, x').``

Covariance functions are a fundamental component of gaussian processes: as noted in the gpp_math.hpp header comments,
gaussian processes are defined by a mean function and a covariance function.  Covariance functions describe how
two random variables change in relation to each other--more explicitly, in a GP they specify how similar two points are.
The choice of covariance function is important because it encodes our assumptions about how the "world" behaves.

Covariance functions also generally have hyperparameters (e.g., signal/background noise, length scales) that specify the
assumed behavior of the Gaussian Process. Specifying hyperparameters is tricky because changing them fundamentally changes
the behavior of the GP. :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces.optimization_interface` together
with :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces.log_likelihood_interface` provide methods
optimizing and evaluating model fit, respectively.

    r"""Interface for a covariance function: covariance of two points and spatial/hyperparameter derivatives.

    .. Note:: comments are copied from the class comments of CovarianceInterface in gpp_covariance.hpp

    Abstract class to enable evaluation of covariance functions--supports the evaluation of the covariance between two
    points, as well as the gradient with respect to those coordinates and gradient/hessian with respect to the
    hyperparameters of the covariance function.

    Covariance operaters, ``cov(x_1, x_2)`` are SPD.  Due to the symmetry, there is no need to differentiate wrt x_1 and x_2; hence
    the gradient operation should only take gradients wrt dim variables, where ``dim = |x_1|``

    Hyperparameters (denoted ``\theta_j``) are stored as class member data by subclasses.

    Implementers of this ABC are required to manage their own hyperparameters.

        This distinction is important for maintaining the desired symmetry.  ``Cov(x, y) = Cov(y, x)``.
        Additionally, ``\pderiv{Cov(x, y)}{x} = \pderiv{Cov(y, x)}{x}``.
        However, in general, ``\pderiv{Cov(x, y)}{x} != \pderiv{Cov(y, x)}{y}`` (NOT equal!  These may differ by a negative sign)

        Hence to avoid separate implementations for differentiating against first vs second argument, this function only handles
        differentiation against the first argument.  If you need ``\pderiv{Cov(y, x)}{x}``, just swap points x and y.

        The Hessian matrix of the covariance evaluated at x_1, x_2 with respect to the hyperparameters.  The Hessian is defined as:

        where "cov" abbreviates covariance(x_1, x_2) and "n" refers to the number of hyperparameters.

        Unless noted otherwise in subclasses, the Hessian is symmetric (due to the equality of mixed derivatives when a function
        f is twice continuously differentiable).

        Similarly to the gradients, the Hessian is independent of the order of ``x_1, x_2: H_{cov}(x_1, x_2) = H_{cov}(x_2, x_1)``
