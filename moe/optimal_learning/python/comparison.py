    Adds no names to the class's public namespace (names without pre/postceding underscores).

    Be careful with NaN!
    This object uses dict comparison (which amounts to sorted tuple comparison).
    Sorted tuple comparison in Python *IS NOT* calling __eq__ on every test pair.

    In particular, Python short-circuits comparison when object ids are the same. Identity is equality.
    However, NaN makes it impossible to be consistent here, since NaN != NaN by definition.

    So::

      >> a = {'k': float('nan')}  # Note: float('nan') is not interned (no floats are)
      >> float('nan') == float('nan')  # False: by definition in IEEE754
      >> a == a  # True: short-circuits b/c both floats have the same object id
      >> a == copy.deepcopy(a)  # True: WHOA!

    WHOA: You might think deepcopy would produce *different* object ids, but it doesn't. Instead of interning,
    ``float`` have a short cache for already-created objects (the "free-list") so a new ``float`` is NOT created.
    This is generally not crippling because::

      >> b = copy.deepcopy(a)
      >> b['k'] = float('nan')  # Force a new float object
      >> a == b  # False

    Note: ``numpy.nan`` is a Python float and has the same issue. ``numpy.float64(numpy.nan)`` however is
    a ``numpy.float64`` which does not appear to undergo any kind of caching/interning.
