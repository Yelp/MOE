#: Minimum allowed standard deviation value in ``ComputeGradCholeskyVarianceOfPointsPerPoint`` (= machine precision).
#: Values that are too small result in problems b/c we may compute ``std_dev/var`` (which is enormous
#: if ``std_dev = 1.0e-150`` and ``var = 1.0e-300``) since this only arises when we fail to compute ``std_dev = var = 0.0``.
#: Note: this is only relevant if noise = 0.0; this minimum will not affect GPs with noise since this value
#: is below the smallest amount of noise users can meaningfully add.
#: This value was chosen to be consistent with the singularity condition in scipy.linalg.cho_factor
#: and tested for robustness with the setup in test_1d_analytic_ei_edge_cases().

class GaussianProcess(GaussianProcessInterface):

    r"""Implementation of a GaussianProcess strictly in Python.

    .. Note:: Comments in this class are copied from this object's superclass in :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces.gaussian_process_interface`.

    Object that encapsulates Gaussian Process Priors (GPPs).  A GPP is defined by a set of
    (sample point, function value, noise variance) triples along with a covariance function that relates the points.
    Each point has dimension dim.  These are the training data; for example, each sample point might specify an experimental
    cohort and the corresponding function value is the objective measured for that experiment.  There is one noise variance
    value per function value; this is the measurement error and is treated as N(0, noise_variance) Gaussian noise.

    GPPs estimate a real process \ms f(x) = GP(m(x), k(x,x'))\me (see file docs).  This class deals with building an estimator
    to the actual process using measurements taken from the actual process--the (sample point, function val, noise) triple.
    Then predictions about unknown points can be made by sampling from the GPP--in particular, finding the (predicted)
    mean and variance.  These functions (and their gradients) are provided in ComputeMeanOfPoints, ComputeVarianceOfPoints,
    etc.

    Further mathematical details are given in the implementation comments, but we are essentially computing:

    | ComputeMeanOfPoints    : ``K(Xs, X) * [K(X,X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} * y = Ks^T * K^{-1} * y``
    | ComputeVarianceOfPoints: ``K(Xs, Xs) - K(Xs,X) * [K(X,X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} * K(X,Xs) = Kss - Ks^T * K^{-1} * Ks``

    This (estimated) mean and variance characterize the predicted distributions of the actual \ms m(x), k(x,x')\me
    functions that underly our GP.

    The "independent variables" for this object are ``points_to_sample``. These points are both the "p" and the "q" in q,p-EI;
    i.e., they are the parameters of both ongoing experiments and new predictions. Recall that in q,p-EI, the q points are
    called ``points_to_sample`` and the p points are called ``points_being_sampled.`` Here, we need to make predictions about
    both point sets with the GP, so we simply call the union of point sets ``points_to_sample.``

    In GP computations, there is really no distinction between the "q" and "p" points from EI, ``points_to_sample`` and
    ``points_being_sampled``, respectively. However, in EI optimization, we only need gradients of GP quantities wrt
    ``points_to_sample``, so users should call members functions with ``num_derivatives = num_to_sample`` in that context.
