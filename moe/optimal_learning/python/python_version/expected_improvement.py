    This is the primary entry-point for EI optimization in the optimal_learning library. It offers our best shot at
    improving robustness by combining higher accuracy methods like gradient descent with fail-safes like random/grid search.

    Returns the optimal set of q points to sample CONCURRENTLY by solving the q,p-EI problem.  That is, we may want to run 4
    experiments at the same time and maximize the EI across all 4 experiments at once while knowing of 2 ongoing experiments
    (4,2-EI). This function handles this use case. Evaluation of q,p-EI (and its gradient) for q > 1 or p > 1 is expensive
    (requires monte-carlo iteration), so this method is usually very expensive.

        .. Note:: comments here are copied from gpp_math.cpp, ExpectedImprovementEvaluator::ComputeExpectedImprovement().

        Let ``Ls * Ls^T = Vars`` and ``w`` = vector of IID normal(0,1) variables
        Then:
        ``y = mus + Ls * w``  (Equation 4, from file docs)
        simulates drawing from our GP with mean mus and variance Vars.

        Then as given in the file docs, we compute the improvement:
        Then the improvement for this single sample is:
        ``I = { best_known - min(y)   if (best_known - min(y) > 0)      (Equation 5 from file docs)``
        ``    {          0               else``
        This is implemented as ``max_{y} (best_known - y)``.  Notice that improvement takes the value 0 if it would be negative.

        Since we cannot compute ``min(y)`` directly, we do so via monte-carlo (MC) integration.  That is, we draw from the GP
        repeatedly, computing improvement during each iteration, and averaging the result.

        See Scott's PhD thesis, sec 6.2.

        For performance, this function vectorizes the monte-carlo integration loop, using numpy's mask feature to skip
        iterations where the improvement is not positive.

        Lastly, under some situations (e.g., ``points_to_sample`` and ``points_begin_sampled`` are too close
        together or too close to ``points_sampled``), the GP-Variance matrix, ``Vars`` is
        [numerically] singular so that the cholesky factorization ``Ls * Ls^T = Vars`` cannot
        be computed reliably.

        When this happens (as detected by a numpy/scipy ``LinAlgError``), we instead resort to
        a combination of the SVD and the QR factorization to compute the cholesky factorization
        more reliably. SVD and QR (see code) have extremely numerically stable algorithms.

        .. Note:: comments here are copied from gpp_math.cpp, ExpectedImprovementEvaluator::ComputeGradExpectedImprovement().

        Mechanism is similar to the computation of EI, where points' contributions to the gradient are thrown out of their
        corresponding ``improvement <= 0.0``.

        Thus ``\nabla(\mu)`` only contributes when the ``winner`` (point w/best improvement this iteration) is the current point.
        That is, the gradient of ``\mu`` at ``x_i`` wrt ``x_j`` is 0 unless ``i == j`` (and only this result is stored in
        ``grad_mu``).  The interaction with ``grad_chol_decomp`` is harder to know a priori (like with
        ``grad_mu``) and has a more complex structure (rank 3 tensor), so the derivative wrt ``x_j`` is computed fully, and
        the relevant submatrix (indexed by the current ``winner``) is accessed each iteration.

        For performance, this function vectorizes the monte-carlo integration loop, using numpy's mask feature to skip
        iterations where the improvement is not positive. Some additional cleverness is required to vectorize the
        accesses into grad_chol_decomp, since we cannot afford to run a loop (even over ``normals_compressed``) in Python.

        ``points_to_sample`` is the "q" and ``points_being_sampled`` is the "p" in q,p-EI.

        Computes the expected improvement ``EI(Xs) = E_n[[f^*_n(X) - min(f(Xs_1),...,f(Xs_m))]^+]``, where ``Xs``
        are potential points to sample (union of ``points_to_sample`` and ``points_being_sampled``) and ``X`` are
        already sampled points.  The ``^+`` indicates that the expression in the expectation evaluates to 0 if it
        is negative.  ``f^*(X)`` is the MINIMUM over all known function evaluations (``points_sampled_value``),
        whereas ``f(Xs)`` are *GP-predicted* function evaluations.

        In words, we are computing the expected improvement (over the current ``best_so_far``, best known
        objective function value) that would result from sampling (aka running new experiments) at
        ``points_to_sample`` with ``points_being_sampled`` concurrent/ongoing experiments.

        In general, the EI expression is complex and difficult to evaluate; hence we use Monte-Carlo simulation to approximate it.
        When faster (e.g., analytic) techniques are available, we will prefer them.

        The idea of the MC approach is to repeatedly sample at the union of ``points_to_sample`` and
        ``points_being_sampled``. This is analogous to gaussian_process_interface.sample_point_from_gp,
        but we sample ``num_union`` points at once:
        ``y = \mu + Lw``
        where ``\mu`` is the GP-mean, ``L`` is the ``chol_factor(GP-variance)`` and ``w`` is a vector
        of ``num_union`` draws from N(0, 1). Then:
        ``improvement_per_step = max(max(best_so_far - y), 0.0)``
        Observe that the inner ``max`` means only the smallest component of ``y`` contributes in each iteration.
        We compute the improvement over many random draws and average.

        The MC computation of grad EI is similar to the computation of EI (decsribed in
        compute_expected_improvement). We differentiate ``y = \mu + Lw`` wrt ``points_to_sample``;
        only terms from the gradient of ``\mu`` and ``L`` contribute. In EI, we computed:
        ``improvement_per_step = max(max(best_so_far - y), 0.0)``
        and noted that only the smallest component of ``y`` may contribute (if it is > 0.0).
        Call this index ``winner``. Thus in computing grad EI, we only add gradient terms
