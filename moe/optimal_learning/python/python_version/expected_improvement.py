    .. NOTE:: The following comments are copied from multistart_expected_improvement_optimization() in cpp_wrappers/expected_improvement.py

    Returns the optimal set of q points to sample CONCURRENTLY by solving the q,p-EI problem.  That is, we may want to run 4
    experiments at the same time and maximize the EI across all 4 experiments at once while knowing of 2 ongoing experiments
    (4,2-EI). This function handles this use case. Evaluation of q,p-EI (and its gradient) for q > 1 or p > 1 is expensive
    (requires monte-carlo iteration), so this method is usually very expensive.

    Compared to ComputeHeuristicSetOfPointsToSample() (``gpp_heuristic_expected_improvement_optimization.hpp``), this function
    makes no external assumptions about the underlying objective function. Instead, it utilizes the Expected (Parallel)
    Improvement, allowing the GP to account for ongoing/incomplete experiments.

    If ``num_samples_to_generate = 1``, this is the same as ComputeOptimalPointToSampleWithRandomStarts().

        Since we cannot compute ``min(y)`` directly, we do so via monte-carlo (MC) integration.  That is, we draw from the GP

        .. Note:: comments here are copied from gpp_math.cpp, ExpectedImprovementEvaluator::ComputeGradExpectedImprovement().

        Computes gradient of EI (see ExpectedImprovementEvaluator::ComputeGradExpectedImprovement) wrt current_point.

        Mechanism is similar to the computation of EI, where points' contributions to the gradient are thrown out of their
        corresponding ``improvement <= 0.0``.  There is some additional subtlety here because we are only computing the gradient
        of EI with respect to the current point (stored at index ``index_of_current_point``).

        Thus ``\nabla(\mu)`` only contributes when the ``winner`` (point w/best improvement this iteration) is the current point.
        That is, the gradient of ``\mu`` at ``x_i`` wrt ``x_j`` is 0 unless ``i == j`` (and only this result is stored in
        ``grad_mu``).  The interaction with ``grad_chol_decomp`` is harder to know a priori (like with
        ``grad_mu``) and has a more complex structure (rank 3 tensor), so the derivative wrt ``x_j`` is computed fully, and
        the relevant submatrix (indexed by the current ``winner``) is accessed each iteration.

        For performance, this function vectorizes the monte-carlo integration loop, using numpy's mask feature to skip
        iterations where the improvement is not positive. Some additional cleverness is required to vectorize the
        accesses into grad_chol_decomp, since we cannot afford to run a loop (even over ``normals_compressed``) in Python.
