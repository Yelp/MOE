r"""Tools to compute log likelihood-like measures of model fit and optimize them (wrt the hyperparameters of covariance) to select the best model for a given set of historical data.

See the file comments in interfaces/log_likelihood_interface.py for an overview of log likelihood-like metrics and their role
in model selection. This file provides an implementation of the Log Marginal Likelihood.

LOG MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD (LML):
(Rasmussen & Williams, 5.4.1)
The Log Marginal Likelihood measure comes from the ideas of Bayesian model selection, which use Bayesian inference
to predict distributions over models and their parameters.  The cpp file comments explore this idea in more depth.
For now, we will simply state the relevant result.  We can build up the notion of the "marginal likelihood":
probability(observed data GIVEN sampling points (``X``), model hyperparameters, model class (regression, GP, etc.)),
which is denoted: ``p(y|X,\theta,H_i)`` (see the cpp file comments for more).

So the marginal likelihood deals with computing the probability that the observed data was generated from (another
way: is easily explainable by) the given model.

The marginal likelihood is in part paramaterized by the model's hyperparameters; e.g., as mentioned above.  Thus
we can search for the set of hyperparameters that produces the best marginal likelihood and use them in our model.
Additionally, a nice property of the marginal likelihood optimization is that it automatically trades off between
model complexity and data fit, producing a model that is reasonably simple while still explaining the data reasonably
well.  See the cpp file comments for more discussion of how/why this works.

In general, we do not want a model with perfect fit and high complexity, since this implies overfit to input noise.
We also do not want a model with very low complexity and poor data fit: here we are washing the signal out with
(assumed) noise, so the model is simple but it provides no insight on the data.

This is not magic.  Using GPs as an example, if the covariance function is completely mis-specified, we can blindly
go through with marginal likelihood optimization, obtain an "optimal" set of hyperparameters, and proceed... never
realizing that our fundamental assumptions are wrong.  So care is always needed.

    See GaussianProcessLogMarginalLikelihood and GaussianProcessLeaveOneOutLogLikelihood for an overview of some
    example log likelihood-like measures.

    Optimizers are: null ('dumb' search), gradient descent, newton
    Newton is the suggested optimizer, which is not presently available in Python (use the C++ interface). In Python,
    gradient descent is suggested.
    TODO(eliu): implement hessians and newton's method (GH-57)

    'dumb' search means this will just evaluate the objective log likelihood measure at num_multistarts 'points'
    (hyperparameters) in the domain, uniformly sampled using latin hypercube sampling.

    See gpp_python_common.cpp for C++ enum declarations laying out the options for objective and optimizer types.

    Currently, during optimization, we recommend that the coordinates of the initial guesses not differ from the
    coordinates of the optima by more than about 1 order of magnitude. This is a very (VERY!) rough guideline for
    sizing the domain and gd_parameters.num_multistarts; i.e., be wary of sets of initial guesses that cover the space too sparsely.

    Solution is guaranteed to lie within the region specified by "domain"; note that this may not be a
    true optima (i.e., the gradient may be substantially nonzero).

    That is, the probability of observing the training values, y, given the training points, X,
    and hyperparameters (of the covariance function), ``\theta``.

    This is a measure of how likely it is that the observed values came from our Gaussian Process Prior.

    .. Note:: This is a copy of GaussianProcessLogMarginalLikelihood's class comments in cpp_wrappers/log_likelihood.py.
      See this file's comments and interfaces.log_likelihood_interface for more details as well as the cpp_wrappers version.

    Given a particular covariance function (including hyperparameters) and
    training data ((point, function value, measurement noise) tuples), the log marginal likelihood is the log probability that
    the data were observed from a Gaussian Process would have generated the observed function values at the given measurement
    points.  So log marginal likelihood tells us "the probability of the observations given the assumptions of the model."
    Log marginal sits well with the Bayesian Inference camp.
    (Rasmussen & Williams p118)

    This quantity primarily deals with the trade-off between model fit and model complexity.  Handling this trade-off is automatic
    in the log marginal likelihood calculation.  See Rasmussen & Williams 5.2 and 5.4.1 for more details.

    We can use the log marginal likelihood to determine how good our model is.  Additionally, we can maximize it by varying
    hyperparameters (or even changing covariance functions) to improve our model quality.  Hence this class provides access
    to functions for computing log marginal likelihood and its hyperparameter gradients.

        ``\log(det(K)) = 2 * \sum_i \log(L_ii)``
        The latter method is (currently) preferred for computing ``\log(det(K))`` due to reduced chance for overflow
        and (possibly) better numerical conditioning.
