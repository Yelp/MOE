class RepeatedDomain(DomainInterface):

    """A generic domain type for simultaneously manipulating ``num_repeats`` points in a "regular" domain (the kernel).

    .. Note:: Comments in this class are copied from RepeatedDomain in gpp_domain.hpp.

    .. Note:: the kernel domain is *not* copied. Instead, the kernel functions are called
      ``num_repeats`` times in a loop. In some cases, data reordering is also necessary
      to preserve the output properties (e.g., uniform distribution).

    For some use cases (e.g., q,p-EI optimization with q > 1), we need to simultaneously
    manipulate several points within the same domain. To support this use case, we have
    the ``RepeatedDomain``, a light-weight wrapper around any DomainInterface subclass
    that kernalizes that object's functionality.

    In general, kernel domain operations need be performed ``num_repeats`` times, once
    for each point. This class hides the looping logic so that use cases like various
    :class:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces.optimization_interface.OptimizerInterface`
    subclasses do not need to be explicitly aware
    of whether they are optimizing 1 point or 50 points. Instead, the OptimizableInterface
    implementation provides problem_size() and appropriately sized gradient information.
    Coupled with RepeatedDomain, Optimizers can remain oblivious.

    In simpler terms, say we want to solve 5,0-EI in a parameter-space of dimension 3.
    So we would have 5 points moving around in a 3D space. The 3D space, whatever it is,
    is the kernel domain. We "repeat" the kernel 5 times; in practice this mostly amounts to
    simple loops around kernel functions and sometimes data reordering is also needed.

    .. Note:: this operation is more complex than just working in a higher dimensional space.
      3 points in a 2D simplex is not the same as 1 point in a 6D simplex; e.g.,
      ``[(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5)]`` is valid in the first scenario but not in the second.

    Where the member domain takes ``kernel_input``, this class's members take an array with
    shape ``(num_repeats, ) + kernel_input.shape``. Similarly ``kernel_output`` becomes an
    array with shape ``(num_repeats, ) + kernel_output.shape``.

    For example, ``check_point_inside()`` calls the kernel domain's ``check_point_inside()``
    function ``num_repeats`` times, returning True only if all ``num_repeats`` input
    points are inside the kernel domain.
