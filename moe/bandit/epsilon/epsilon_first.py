        Computes the allocation to each arm based on the given subtype, historical info, and hyperparameter info.

        Works with k-armed bandits (k >= 1).

        The Algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit#Approximate_solutions

        This method starts with a pure exploration phase, followed by a pure exploitation phase.
        If we have a total of T trials, the first :math:`\epsilon` T trials, we only explore.
        After that, we only exploit (t = :math:`\epsilon` T, :math:`\epsilon` T + 1, ..., T).

        This method will pull a random arm in the exploration phase.
        Then this method will pull the optimal arm (best expected return) in the exploitation phase.

        In case of a tie in the exploitation phase, the method will split the allocation among the optimal arms.

        For example, if we have three arms, two arms (arm1 and arm2) with an average payoff of 0.5
        (``{win:10, lose:10, total:20}``)
        and a new arm (arm3, average payoff is 0 and total is 0).

        Let the epsilon :math:`\epsilon` be 0.1.

        The allocation depends on which phase we are in:

        *Case 1: T = 50*

        Recall that T = number to sample + number sampled. number sampled :math:`= 20 + 20 + 0 = 40`.
        So we are on trial #41. We explore the first :math:`\epsilon T = 0.1 * 50 = 5` trials
        and thus we are in the exploitation phase. We split the allocation between the optimal arms arm1 and arm2.

        ``{arm1: 0.5, arm2: 0.5, arm3: 0.0}``

        *Case 2: T = 500*

        We explore the first :math:`\epsilon T = 0.1 * 500 = 50` trials.
        Since we are on trail #41, we are in the exploration phase. We choose arms randomly:

        ``{arm1: 0.33, arm2: 0.33, arm3: 0.33}``

        :return: the dictionary of (arm, allocation) key-value pairs
        :rtype: a dictionary of (str, float64) pairs
        :raise: ValueError when ``sample_arms`` are empty.
